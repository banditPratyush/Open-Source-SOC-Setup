In this setup, we will do a single node deployment. 

Clone the Wazuh docker git repository 

git clone https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-docker.git -b v4.3.7 --depth=1 

Update the certs config 

To update the certs config, visit wazuh-docker/single-node/config 

There you will find the certs.yml if you want to update the IP or name update here 

Then use the generate-indexer-certs.yml which is inside wazuh-docker/single-node to generate your certificates for the HTTPS connection. 

docker-compose -f generate-indexer-certs.yml run --rm generator 

This will save the certificates into the config/wazuh_indexer_ssl_certs directory. 

Start the docker 

docker-compose up -d 

Visit https://<Your Instance IP> 

If you are not able to get your login page, then: 

Check if the docker is running properly 

sudo docker ps
